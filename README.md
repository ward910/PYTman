### APP
My first site using Flask and hosted on heroku used bootstrap 4.1 (I didn't use 5 because only 4.1 documentation was translated to my language). I created a system that every time a user enters it shows a different subject but it didn't go as planned because heroku is static and it just seemed to change the subject when I do a rebuild. This site is a proof of knowledge for me and I found it very easy and thought it would be more difficult.
